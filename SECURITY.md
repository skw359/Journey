# Security Policy for Journey

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is a #1 priority for this app. Though no code exists for sending data anywhere, user security is extremely important and I take all potential vulnerabilities seriously. If you have discovered a security issue in Journey, I encourage you to report it to me.

### Contact

To report a vulnerability, please contact security@journeywatchapp.com.

### Guidelines

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide as much detail as possible to help me reproduce and resolve the issue. Include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.

### Response

I aim to acknowledge your report within 24 hours (likely less than that) and will provide an estimated timeline for resolution. I will keep you informed throughout the process and notify you when the issue has been resolved.

## Security Policies

- Security is a two-way street. I recommend you to not disclose such vulnerability when discovered or reported until itâ€™s fixed. I am committed to fixing critical vulnerabilities promptly and responsibly.
